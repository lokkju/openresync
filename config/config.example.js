  //     * name: The TYPE of the subresource, for example Property might have an $expand of BuyerAgent. In this
  //             case, the TYPE of the subresource maps to Member, so set the name to Member.
  //     * fieldName: with the example above where Property has an $expand of BuyerAgent, the 'fieldName' would be
  //                  BuyerAgent
  //     * purgeFromParent: boolean (optional, default false). For an expanded resource, should we delete the records
  //                        when the parent is updated or purged (deleted)? In short, you'd want to set this to false if
  //                        the $expand'ed resource can stand on its own, and true if it only makes sense to exist with
  //                        the parent. Let's use an example. If we are syncing the Property resource, with an $expand
  //                        of Media, and an update of the Property record comes in, how should we handle the existing
  //                        Media records we've already synced for that Property record? We probably want to delete
  //                        them, because we will be syncing the new set of Media records, and this simply solves the
  //                        problem whereby the new set of Media records has fewer or different records than before. As
  //                        another example though, if we are syncing the Property resource, with an $expand of Member,
  //                        and if the MLS the Property record has been deleted, do we want to delete its related Member
  //                        record? Probably not, because of the likelihood that other Property records refer to that
  //                        Member.
